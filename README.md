# Real-estate-price-prediction

This project aims to predict real estate prices using machine learning techniques. It uses historical property data to train models that can estimate the market value of real estate properties.

## Project Overview

The model analyzes various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other relevant factors to predict the price of real estate properties accurately.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training with multiple algorithms
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Price prediction on new data

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
